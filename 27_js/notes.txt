K27: JS is just Scheme with Java syntax
2025-01-06
time spent: 5 mins

DISCO:
* Scheme is NOT fun
* Comment in scheme using semicolons, Comment in javascript using /* */ or //

QCC:
* How do you implement js with html? Is there a file linkage or an automatic integration?
* Can we do in-line js instead?
