 Is this plaintext, though?

<!-- Q: What happens when you access this file via
         http://localhost:5000/static/foo.html 
                 ?

     A: It will open up a web page that has the words "Is this plaintext, though?" on it. It will show the contents of this HTML file. It is not actually plaintext because it is wrapped around HTML tags.
