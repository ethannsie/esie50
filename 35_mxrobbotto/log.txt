DISCO:
- Copilot needs to be directed slowly with 1-2 prompts at a time.
- Generally good at taking error messages and fixing code
- Did not leave as many comments as we'd expect.

Q/C/C:
q0: It took 13 prompts for us to get the project fully implemented and it took us 1 more to make the website look nice.
q1: Yes, we caught a lot of errors in the implementation of the project directions, but we were able to go step by step to correct them with the bot based on what we observed.
q2: The bot's output is definitely a lot more efficient, but it does not have the foresight that our team had in terms of planning and implementation. The bot needed a little bit of a push to get to the finish line. But once it gets there, it's very good at styling the base website to look nice.
