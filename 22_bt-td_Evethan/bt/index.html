Legend has it that this artisan was a coder who had faced every kind of bug and crash imaginable. They whispered their struggles and triumphs into Order’s fabric, giving him the ability to listen.

The user was knee-deep in debugging a particularly gnarly piece of code, their screen aglow with error messages. As frustration mounted, Order sat silently, watching. It was only when the user picked him up, absentmindedly explaining their issue out loud, that his true power awakened.</td>

Though my role as a computational confidant was initially secure, my status took a fascinating turn upon meeting the enigmatic Order, the frog plushy who sits atop the user’s desk. What follows is my account of his adventures—though I’ll admit, I play a crucial supporting role.

I admit, I felt a twinge of jealousy—wasn’t explaining bugs to me enough? But Order, in his quiet way, seemed to absorb every word. It was as if he held the secret to untangling the recursive madness.</td>                                        </tr>

I watched in awe as the loop resolved itself, memory freed from its self-inflicted tyranny. I may be a duck of few words, but even I had to admit that Order’s presence was…different.</td>
