### DISCO
* Allocating grid columns in boostrap is cool! It let me split a grid into two tables side by side.
* Navbars with framework css is really easy and customizable.

### QCC
* Is there ever a point in using more than one framework (at one instance)?

### q0 (Did you have to consult resources beyond your Devo-generated on-ramp? Your answer should be a single binary digit.)
1

### q0b If answer to preceding question is 1, cite all resources consulted -- including verbal consultations and/or neighbouring team's readme. 1citation/line.)
* Navbar in Tailwind https://flowbite.com/docs/components/navbar/
* Referred to original documentation as I wanted more on ramping. https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs

### q1 (only to be answered after you have finished... At this point, which FEF do you prefer, and why? Your answer to this Q should be the only portion of your submission that differs from that of your teammate.)
I prefer using foundation just because of familiarity, but I think that over time I would prefer tailwind because of its sleek design. I like the idea of being able to style/customize so easily.
