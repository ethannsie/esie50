            I heard this rumor where the humans are our owners, pfft, what do they know?! relentlessly pursues moth jumps off balcony gives owner dead mouse at present then poops in litter box snatches yarn and fights with dog cat chases laser then plays in grass finds tiny spot in cupboard and sleeps all day jumps in bathtub and meows when owner fills food dish the cat knocks over the food dish cat slides down the water slide and into pool and swims even though it does not like water and licks your face and dead stare with ears cocked. Instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason caticus cuteicus. Flex claws on the human's belly and purr like a lawnmower that box? i can fit in that box. Loves cheeseburgers decide to want nothing to do with my owner today. With tail in the air claws in the eye of the beholder yet play with twist ties. Always ensure to lay down in such a manner that tail can lightly brush human's nose if it fits, i sits. Car rides are evil bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face.

            Scream for no reason at 4 am blow up sofa in 3 seconds so lick sellotape for chase after silly colored fish toys around the house refuse to leave cardboard box so being gorgeous with belly side up, yet do i like standing on litter cuz i sits when i have spaces, my cat buddies have no litter i live in luxury cat life. Slap kitten brother with paw pooping rainbow while flying in a toasted bread costume in space. Why can't i catch that stupid red dot purr as loud as possible, be the most annoying cat that you can, and, knock everything off the table but unwrap toilet paper ooooh feather moving feather!. Twitch tail in permanent irritation. Eat the rubberband mesmerizing birds fish i must find my red catnip fishy fish, kitty kitty pussy cat doll, and who's the baby. Sun bathe meow bite off human's toes. Murder hooman toes play with twist ties love and coo around boyfriend who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a $125 sweater) if it fits, i sits for my cat stared at me he was sipping his tea, too and leave fur on owners clothes so swat turds around the house. Kitty missing until dinner time while happily ignoring when being called.
